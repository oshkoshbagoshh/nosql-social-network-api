# NoSQL Social Network API

## Description

This is a social network API built with MongoDB, Express,  and Mongoose. It allows users to create a user profile, add friends, add thoughts, and react to thoughts. Users can also add reactions to other users' thoughts.

The goal for this project was to create all of the API routing for the back-end and test it using Insomnia Core.
